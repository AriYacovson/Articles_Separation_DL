A DL (Deep Learning) project developed for the Asif Library. They've provided positive feedback, highlighting significant time savings due to the project.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to automate manual processes. One such task involves taking an entire book composed of multiple articles (provided in a single PDF file) and returning each article as a separate PDF file.

## Methodology
To achieve this, we trained a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model. We gathered training data by scraping articles that were already uploaded to the website. This data was then labeled, distinguishing between first pages of articles and subsequent pages.
